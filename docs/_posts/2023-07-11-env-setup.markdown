### Notes

This document is only suitable for Windows OS. In this course, we will use Eclipse to write program in Java. This tutorial will go through essential basic steps to guide you set up required environments. **It is highly recommended to follow the original order of this tutorial as it presented to complete the setup for the course.**

### Section 1: Java JDK Environment Set-up

#### Step 1

[Click here to download the JDK 18.0.2.1](https://download.oracle.com/java/18/archive/jdk-18.0.2.1_windows-x64_bin.exe)

The JDK version we recommend to use is 18.0.2.1. **Please DO NOT use other versions of JDK, including the JDKs you downloaded from other sources.** You may need VPN to download.

#### Step 2

Open the installation package, and follow the instructions as appeared to finish the installation.

#### Step 3

To verify the completion of your installation, open ‚ÄúCommand Prompt‚Äù, enter `java -version`.
**[Note: there is a blank space between `java` and `-version`].**
You should see the similar result as following screenshot:

#### Step 4

Enter `java --list-modules | findstr "jdk.jshell"`. It should show the output as `jdk.jshell@18.0.2.1` (see screenshot below).

### Section 2: Eclipse Set-up

#### Step 1:

Go to: [Eclipse Download Page](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/)

#### Step 2:

Find ‚ÄúEclipse IDE for Java Developers‚Äù section first, then click on the `Windows x86_64` shown in the picture below:

![eclipse-dl](imgs\2023-07-11-env-setup\eclipse-dl.png)

#### Step 3:

Click `Download` button (If you want to change the mirror for a better connection, just do it üòä).

![eclipse-dl-2](imgs\2023-07-11-env-setup\eclipse-dl-2.png)

#### Step 4: 

Extract file you just downloaded, and move it to folder `C:\Program Files`. You‚Äôll able to access folder: `C:\Program Files\eclipse`.
**Optional**: Create a shortcut of Eclipse in Desktop (You may want it): Right click on ‚Äúeclipse.exe‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúSend to‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúDesktop (create shortcut)‚Äù .

#### Step 5:

Open *Eclipse*, you should see a prompt windows similar like the screenshot below. You can choose to use the default Workspace path or change to a customized directory. Hit ‚ÄúLaunch‚Äù after you feel satisfied with the directory.

![eclipse-start](imgs\2023-07-11-env-setup\eclipse-start.png)

#### Step 6:

Now you should be ready to play with *Eclipse*. üòä

In menu on the top, click `File ‚Üí New ‚Üí Java Project`. In the new Dialog Window, fill the project name: `MyFirstJavaProject`, then hit Finish (You may want to refer to the screenshot below).

![create-project](imgs\2023-07-11-env-setup\create-project.png)

![create-project-2](imgs\2023-07-11-env-setup\create-project-2.png)

#### Step 7:

Select `MyFirstJavaProject ` project we just created in left panel of *Eclipse*. In menu on the top, click `File ‚Üí New ‚Üí Class`.

Filling the Class name using `FirstJavaProgram`, and check with the option called:  `public tactic void main(String[] args)`, then hit `Finish` button. You may want to refer to the screenshot below:

![create-class](imgs\2023-07-11-env-setup\create-class.png)

#### Step 8:

Then you need to enter the following code:

```java
System.out.println("Hello World!");
```

Now your program looks like:

![helloworld](imgs\2023-07-11-env-setup\helloworld.png)

Then, click on the button:

![run-program](imgs\2023-07-11-env-setup\run-program.png)

Your console now looks like:

![console](imgs\2023-07-11-env-setup\console.png)

#### Congratulations! You successfully have setup the Eclipse environment!

### Appendix I: JDK System Environment Parameters Set-Up

After you have installed JDK, if `java -version` command doesn‚Äôt return the expected result, you may need to add JDK path to your system environment variables. Following instructions will briefly guide you through the configuration process:

#### Step 1:

Find the location where hold your Java JDK installation. By default, it should be similar as: `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-18.0.2.1`.

#### Step 2:

Copy your JDK path and append the name of **bin folder**, it should be as following: `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-18.0.2.1\bin`
(It is just an example, you will need to customize it based on your own case.)

#### Step 3:

Search for Environment Variables and open it.

![env-variable](imgs\2023-07-11-env-setup\env-variable.png)

#### Step 4:

Add the path you copied in Step 2 in the `PATH` variable in System Variables. Remember to save everything.
